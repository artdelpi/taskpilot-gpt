<%# 
  This view supports both Turbo Frame requests (when opening the project details modal)
  and full-page navigation (when visiting /projects/:id directly).

    .If it's a Turbo Frame request, we render only the "project_details" frame.
     The content will be injected into the placeholder inside the modal.

    .If it's a full-page request, we wrap the same frame inside a container
     and also display a "Back to Projects" button below it.

  This ensures we reuse the same "_details" partial for both contexts.
